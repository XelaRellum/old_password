# old_password
Implementations of the MySQL/MariaDB legacy function `OLD_PASSWORD`.

## Introduction

This is a collection of functions that recreate the legacy password generation function `OLD_PASSWORD` used by MySQL < v4.1.

You can use these functions to keep your applications running even after the `OLD_PASSWORD` function has been dropped from MySQL/MariaDB or your ORM doesn't allow the use of functions.
